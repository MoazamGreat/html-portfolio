<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Just a kind person who wants to help the society. Rather than collecting donations and asking differnt organizations, 
  I will generate my own money from the skills that I am learning and spend most of the money to the poor. That is my drean.
  That is the reason that i am still living everyday of my life with new hope. I believe my aspirations will one day become real
</p>

<p>
  My name is Moazam Mustafa. I belong to a decent family. I have gained higher education from one of the prestigious universities 
  of Pakistan. I have done my majors in mechanical engineering but I believe that this is not what I want to be. So while looking 
  for new jobs and applying for masters, I am in a hunt for my passion and I will continue to pursue it either secretly or openly
  until I get there.
