<h1>The Best Movies According to Mr. Cupcake</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Goodwill Hunting</h3>
<p>This movie has been related with my life. 
    I feel Like I love being surrounded by dumb friends and not some nurds.
    However, it is my responsibility as someone with so much resources to  push harder,
    and have an aim in my life.

<h3>One Piece Film Red</h3>
<p>This story really broke me. It taught me that no matter how 
    good life is, or hom much we have endured to live up to the best moment,
    one day we have to move on.
    And there is always time to fix everything.

<h3>Sanju</h3>
<p>This film taught me all the sacrifices your parents 
    and your friends make just to help you get better in life.</p>
